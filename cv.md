## About me
I am a beginner frontend programmer. \
Passed 4 courses of the Physics faculty of BSU. I decided to leave the university, because I realized how I could spend my time usefully. I was a student of the Department of Biophysics. For my coursework I was working on a mass spectrometry project related to SQL and pascal. \
My strong points: capable of being taught, responsibility, ability to work in team, interest in frontend development.

  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i += 1){
    if ((Number(str[i])) < 5){
      newStr = newStr + '0';
